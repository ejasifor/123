What does a resume look like?
Your resume should include the following sections:

Heading
Skills
Projects
Experience
Education
Consider the following example of a resume for Jenny Smith, who is looking to pursue a Senior Front-End Developer role:


We recommend the following orders for these sections:

Heading, Skills, Projects in that order; Experience and Education in any order.
Heading; Education or Experience in any order; Projects, Skills in that order.
When determining the order of the sections in your resume, choose the one that best highlights your qualifications based on the job description for your desired role.

Note, that a different resume order from the ones we've suggested is acceptable if other sections that are most impactful for the desired role need to be prioritized.

Professional Resume Checklist

General

ù•∑ My resume fits on one page and is in PDF format.

ù•∑ The links in my resume are hyperlinked.

ù•∑ My resume uses one of the following standard orders:

Heading, Skills, Projects, Experience, Education
Heading, Education, Skills, Projects, Experience

ù•∑ The spelling and grammar in my resume are correct.

ù•∑ My resume does not include: age, gender, marital status, photo, or mention of references.

ù•∑ My resume does not include negative language.

ù•∑ My resume does not indicate that I am seeking a job. (This may be extraneous or redundant

    information).


ù•∑ I align all of the text in my resume to left and/or right axis.

ù•∑ The company name and title are emphasized/distinct in my resume.

ù•∑ The content in my resume is optimized for horizontal space. My resume uses space well for

    a reader reading from top to bottom.

ù•∑ I condense lists of single words to the same line.

ù•∑ The section headings in my resume are distinct from other text.

ù•∑ My name is at the top of the page and is larger than other text on my resume.

ù•∑ My resume formatting is consistent throughout - from section headers to bullet point

   alignment.


Hiring Perspective: A nice resume design allows the reader to more easily focus on the content. When there are inconsistencies - such as misalignment - the reader's eye is instead focused on those design errors rather than the words on the resume. Employers and recruiters may perceive you as lacking attention to detail or unprofessional.


Tip: Consider examples of resume formats at Resume Builder and Resume Genius. Use a grammar checker like Grammarly to catch any basic mistakes. However, online grammar checkers aren‚Äôt perfect, so you should always personally proofread or have another person look it over for errors in case any were missed. See more proofreading tips here.


Targeted for Profession

ù•∑ My resume is targeted to a specific job. (General resumes tend to not be effective).

ù•∑ My resume includes keywords, experiences, and skills specific to the job.

ù•∑ I include experiences that showcase successes with my job responsibilities.


Hiring Perspective: Employers and recruiters have to comb through thousands of applications each day. You will stand out better against the competition by highlighting skills and experiences that align with the job posting that you applied for.


Tip: If your past experiences are not related to the job field, include an objective statement, which is 1-2 sentences and explains how your past experiences support your new career path.

Consider this advice as you write it.


Heading

ù•∑ My resume heading includes: my full name, phone number, email and location.

ù•∑ I include links to my LinkedIn, GitHub and/or personal website. If relevant, I also include

    links to my professional Twitter or other social media accounts.


Hiring Perspective: It‚Äôs essential to include your contact information in the heading to ensure recruiters and employers can easily follow-up with you.


Tip: Sometimes people include their full home address in their heading. Although not necessarily "incorrect" to do so, please know that this practice is not an industry standard anymore. Instead, you can just include their location (ie: San Francisco Bay Area; Bangalore, India) instead of an address. 


Education

ù•∑ I include my Nanodegree program in this section, even if currently incomplete.

ù•∑ I include any college, including major or courses.

ù•∑ If applicable, I include relevant courses (from university, community college, online, etc.)

   in this section of my resume.


Hiring Perspective: Employers and recruiters want to see relevant education if possible‚Äîlike a Udacity Nanodegree program‚Äîthat demonstrates initiative to learn relevant skills. The tech industry is constantly changing, so employers typically want to hire a person personally driven enough to stay on the cutting edge of the field even after being hired in a role.


Tip:  If you have a technical or relevant university degree, highlight that over other education. If there is incomplete education that is not in progress, frame this experience positively by focusing on what you did complete. For example: "60 credits toward a bachelor's degree in Computer Science" or "Courses completed in computer science, design, communications." Finally, be sure to spell "Nanodegree" correctly. All Nanodegree programs are listed on Udacity.


Skills

ù•∑ I list relevant and challenging technologies. These include: programming languages,

   frameworks, version control systems, databases, operating systems, image/video/audio

   editing software, etc.


Hiring Perspective: While you may be tempted to include as many skills as possible to appear impressive, employers are only concerned with seeing the skills mentioned in the job posting, so including other skills will look like extraneous information.


Tip: Review your skills to confirm the technologies mentioned are relevant to the job(s) you‚Äôre pursuing. If your resume displays a wide range of skills, note which skills are of particular expertise. Avoid listing technologies like Microsoft Office, Google Drive, Mac & PC, etc. It is assumed someone knows or can easily learn these skills.


Projects

ù•∑ I list only the most relevant projects on my resume. (These projects can include my

   personal, academic or work projects).

ù•∑ I only include about 2-3 projects.

ù•∑ I use a maximum 2-3 bullet points per project.

At least 1 of these bullet point demonstrates an individual contribution.
At least 1 of these bullet point communicates a project result (success metrics, findings).

Hiring Perspective: It‚Äôs essential for you to highlight concrete project results and individual contributions because employers want to see concrete evidence of your skills.


Tip: Whenever you can, describe your work quantitatively. If you can‚Äôt due to the nature of your work, still showcase its success, even when what you achieved wasn‚Äôt what you originally intended. If you have less than 3 work experiences, try to supplement by adding another project to your Project section.


Experience

ù•∑ For each experience listed in this section, I note the company/organization, the title of

   role, start and end date (month & year), and location.

ù•∑ (If applicable) I include unpaid or part-time work, but omitted the words ‚Äúpart-time‚Äù and

    ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù to prevent bias.

ù•∑ I use a maximum 3-4 bullet points for each experience listed, and did not use sub-bullet

   points.

ù•∑ My bullet point statements start with action verbs.

ù•∑ I use the correct tense in bullet point statements: past tense for previous experience,

   current tense for ongoing experience.

ù•∑ Within each job listing, I include:

At least 1 bullet point that communicates how I benefited company or cause.
At least 1 bullet point that provides concrete, numerical evidence such as projects completed, money made, people managed, accomplishments (eg. % increase).
ù•∑ My bullet point statements are one sentence maximum, and are not longer than one and a

    half lines.


Hiring Perspective: An employer only wants you if you can complete work assignments, multitask, and deliver results. This means not only having the technical skills, but also the soft skills to work and communicate well with other team members.


Tip: If you are making a career change and already have professional experience in a different field, try to focus on highlighting valuable soft skills such as team collaboration or public speaking in your work experience, as these are often transferable and important across different industries.
